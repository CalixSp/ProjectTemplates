Sencha Architect Project Templates
----------------------------------

These templates are divided into the following categories for the **Ext** and **Touch** frameworks.

- **Basic** - Very simple, boilerplate templates.
- **Layouts** - Common application layouts.
- **Starter Apps** - Simple yet fully-functional apps.

The following code conventions are used.

- Use PascalCase/TitleCase for all classes (top-level, not instances).
- Assign itemId to all components.  Use these itemdId's in all selectors/refs.
- A viewport should always be used as the top-level view for Ext.  The userClassName should be MainViewPort and the itemId should be mainViewPort.
- Custom CSS/Styles should be avoided.  
- Use the least amount of code possible.
- Use detailed comments in controller code for new user education.
