Sencha Architect Project Templates
----------------------------------

These templates are divided into the following categories for the **Ext** and **Touch** frameworks.

- **Basic** - Very simple, boilerplate templates.
- **Layouts** - Common application layouts.
- **Starter Apps** - Simple yet fully-functional apps.

** Rules for all templates **

- All templates should be as usable as possible
- Use the least amount of code possible.
- Use PascalCase/TitleCase for all classes (top-level, not instances).
- Assign itemId to all components.  Use these itemdId's in all selectors/refs.
- Custom CSS/Styles should be avoided.  
- Use detailed comments in controller code for new user education.

** Rules for Ext templates **
- A viewport should always be used as the top-level view for Ext.  The userClassName should be MainViewPort and the itemId should be mainViewPort.

** Rules for Ext layout templates **
- Header and Footer should have height set to 100 and NOT resizable
- Left, Right, Center, Top, Bottom, etc, panels should be resizable
